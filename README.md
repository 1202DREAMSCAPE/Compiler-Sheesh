# Compiler-Sheesh
Compiler for the self-developed language Sheesh#.

__________________________________________________________________________________
SHEESH# is a compiled procedural language that aims to provide beginner programmers with a quick and intuitive experience to start their programming careers. 

SHEESH# holds inspiration from an existing slang language, conyo, that is usually heard in everyday conversations among high school and college students. The term conyo refers to a language that combines both English and Filipino languages along with vocal expressions.

One of the key features of SHEESH# is its focus on readability and ease of use. The language uses modern straightforward keywords and constructs that are familiar to beginners, making it easier for them to grasp and write code. This helps build confidence and encourages experimentation and exploration. 

In addition to its beginner-friendly nature, SHEESH# supports procedural programming, which allows programmers to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks which makes it easier to organize and structure code, leading to more maintainable and scalable programs
